# Crowdfunding_ETL
In this project, we builty an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and both Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. We also created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
